            In the game Turing Tumble, players construct mechanical computers
            that use the flow of marbles along a board to solve logic problems.
            As the board and its parts are Turing complete, which means that
            they can be used to express any mathematical function, an
            intelligent agent taught to solve a Turing Tumble challenge
            essentially learns how to write code according to a given
            specification.
            <br />
            <br />
            Following this logic, we taught an agent how to write a simple
            program according to a minimal specification, using an abstracted
            version of the Turing Tumble board as reinforcement learning
            training environment. This is related to the emerging field of
            program synthesis, as is for example applied in GitHubâ€™s{" "}
